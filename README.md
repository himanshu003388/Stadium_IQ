## 🛡️ Security Hardening

Stadium IQ incorporates a robust, multi-layer security configuration to protect stadium interfaces:

- **Express Middleware:** Powered by `Helmet` to enforce strict Content Security Policies (CSP), prevent clickjacking, and enforce HSTS.
- **CSRF Token Protection:** Stateless HMAC-signed token validation with built-in expiration check (3600 seconds) and timing-attack resistant comparison (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`).
- **XSS Mitigation:** Integrates `DOMPurify` to sanitize all incoming prompt queries and outgoing AI markdown formats (run on both client and server side).
- **API Defense:** Restricts API endpoint access with rate limit thresholds (30 requests/minute per client IP) to block DDoS and scraping attempts.
- **Context Filtering**: Sanitizes user context via whitelists (`buildSafeContext`) before feeding it to Gemini, blocking malicious prompt injection.
- **Data Protection:** Implements payload size limits (10kb) and input validations on all backend controller routes.

---

## ⚡ Efficiency Optimization

- **Streaming Response Caching:** SSE streaming responses (`/api/chat/stream`) are cached. If a query hits the cache, it is immediately served in a single chunk stream response.
- **Case & Spacing-Insensitive Caching:** User messages are normalized (lowercased and whitespace consolidated) before generating SHA-256 cache keys to maximize cache hits.
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE) Streaming:** Prompts are streamed token-by-token from Gemini via `/api/chat/stream`, which eliminates HTTP connection delays and ensures an instantaneous perceived latency for users.
- **Backend Response Caching:** Frequently asked operations queries are cached in-memory using `node-cache` (TTL 300s, max 1000 keys) indexed by SHA-256 hashed queries, saving API costs and avoiding redundant LLM processing.
- **Vite Bundle Optimizations:** Custom manual chunking in `vite.config.js` groups React vendors, Generative AI engines, and UI utilities into independent bundles, facilitating faster client-side downloads and browser caching.
- **Re-render Optimization:** Key components use `React.memo()` wrapper methods to prevent unnecessary visual updates when unrelated simulation metrics change.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

Our robust verification pipeline ensures operational reliability during peak event hours:

- **Unit Testing:** Vitest + React Testing Library for all 11 components, 2 contexts, and 1 custom hook.
- **Server Security Tests:** Dedicated unit test suite for all server.js logic — `validateChatInput`, `sanitizeInput`, `buildSafeContext`, CSRF token generation/validation — including negative-path and boundary tests.
- **Accessibility Tests:** `jest-axe` integrated in every component test to prevent WCAG regression.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Playwright covers all 7 navigation views, AI chat interaction, streaming response, language selection, keyboard navigation, Eco Mode toggle, transport sort, and Google Maps gate navigation links.

---

## ♿ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Designed to be accessible to all global fans and tournament operators:

- **Semantic HTML5:** Built entirely with proper semantic landmark tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`).
- **Keyboard Traversal:** Complete keyboard focus loop management, arrow-key SVG map navigation, and action execution using Space/Enter.
- **Screen Reader Support:** Configured using ARIA descriptors (`aria-live`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) and custom `.sr-only` descriptive texts.
- **Visual Design:** Fully complies with WCAG AA color contrast guidelines. Supports user configurations such as `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Skip Navigation:** Focus-visible skip links allow power-users to jump directly to operational widgets.
